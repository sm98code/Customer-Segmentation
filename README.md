**Project Title**: Customer segmentation using KNN

**Problem Statement**: I applied clustering techniques to segment customers based on purchasing behavior using mall customer data in this project.

**Methodology**: The customer segmentation project was based on a structured approach using the K-Means clustering algorithm to identify distinct customer groups. The process began with data exploration, examining key attributes like "Age," "Annual Income," and "Spending Score" to understand patterns and relationships in customer behavior. Data preprocessing steps included handling missing values and scaling features to ensure consistency.
The optimal number of clusters was determined using the Elbow Method, balancing model simplicity and segmentation accuracy. The K-Means algorithm was applied with this foundation, creating clusters that grouped customers by shared characteristics. Finally, visualizations of the clusters provided clear insights into each customer segment, highlighting distinct groups such as "High Income, Low Spending" and "Average Income, High Spending," which offer actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies.

**STEPs**:

1. Importing Libraries and Loading Data: The initial cells likely import libraries like pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, and visualization libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn to plot data insights and clustering results.

2. Data Exploration: After loading the dataset, this section likely includes code for examining data attributes (like "Age," "Annual Income," and "Spending Score") and performing preliminary analysis to understand the distribution and relationships between features.

3. Data Preprocessing: Steps like handling missing values, scaling features, or encoding categorical variables may be included here, as these are common in preparing data for machine learning models.

4. Determining Optimal Clusters (K): A section may include the "Elbow Method" or the "Silhouette Score" to decide the optimal number of clusters, k, for K-Means. This step helps to identify the best value of k that balances model simplicity and effectiveness in segmentation.

5. Applying K-Means Clustering: Once the optimal number of clusters is decided, the KMeans function from sklearn.cluster is likely used to segment the data. This involves initializing and fitting the model, and then predicting the clusters for each customer.

6. Visualization of Clusters: The results are then visualized using scatter plots, showing clusters with different colors to distinguish customer segments. Each plot provides insight into how groups of customers are formed based on characteristics like "Annual Income" vs. "Spending Score."

7. Cluster Analysis and Interpretation: The final part may involve interpreting each cluster's characteristics. For example, clusters could represent different types of shoppers (e.g., "High Income, Low Spending," "Average Income, High Spending").

**Key Insights and Results:**

This customer segmentation project revealed several distinct customer profiles, providing valuable insights for targeted marketing. By clustering based on attributes such as "Age," "Annual Income," and "Spending Score," three main customer segments were identified:

High Income, Low Spending: Customers in this segment have a higher income but a relatively low spending score. They represent a potential growth area if targeted with personalized incentives or high-end offerings.

Average Income, High Spending: This segment includes customers with average incomes who are more inclined to spend. They could be valuable for loyalty programs or upselling strategies, as they show a strong engagement with the mall's offerings.

Low Income, Selective Spending: These customers have lower incomes and moderate spending patterns, representing a more cost-conscious segment. Tailored promotions or budget-friendly options could appeal to this group.

The segmentation results allow for a more strategic approach to marketing by addressing each groupâ€™s unique needs and preferences, ultimately aiming to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.
